======================

The four-week team project for Software Design and Implementation (COSC 50) required each group to make its own multiplayer physics game, á la Crayon Physics, in C using GTK and the [Chipmunk physics library](http://chipmunk-physics.net/ "Chipmunk Physics"). This was the first project I developed with a team.

Although not officially appointed as team leader, I took charge of making sure everyone stayed on track. I had a hand in every aspect of the game by filling in where needed and keeping the rest of the group focused on meeting the assigned deadlines. Our finished project was ranked following a demo day and a code review as one of the top three among the twelve groups, and Proferssor Devin Balkcom commended me for being an “outstanding leader for [the] team project.”
